 100개 중에 100 내 몫을 원해

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,099
 Karma come and get some

20
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,400

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,099

 그 미소를 띠며, I'll kiss you goodbye

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
 실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,900

 How you like that?

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,900
 날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,400
 어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,900
 그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,400
 Look up in the sky

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
 It's a bird, it's a plane
