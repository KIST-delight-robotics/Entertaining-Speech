00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,679

 Text me

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,300
 아야 아야 아야 아야

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,799
 Your every picture

9
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,519
 내 머리맡에 두고 싶어

10
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,979
 Oh baby

11
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,439
 Come be my teacher

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,960
 네 모든 걸 다 가르쳐줘

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,679
 Your one, your two

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,259
 Listen to my baby

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,519
 나는 저 하늘을 높이 날고 있어

16
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,799
 (그때 니가 내게 줬던 두 날개로)

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,000
 이제 여긴 너무 높아

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,420
 난 내 눈에 널 맞추고 싶어

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,439
 Yeah, you makin' me a boy with love (whoo)

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,920
 Oh my my my

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
 I've waited all my life

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,460
 내 전부를 함께하고 싶어

23
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,960
 Oh my my my

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,500
 Looking for something right

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,219
 이제 조금은 나 알겠어

26
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,219
 I want something stronger

27
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,000
 I want it

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,460
 Than a moment, than a moment, 

29
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:27,980
 Love

30
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,260
 I have waited longer

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,000
 For a boy with, for a boy with love

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,719
 알게 된 이 후

33
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,760
 내 삶은 온통 너

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,640
 사소한 게 사소하지 않게 만들어버린 너라는 별 

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,760
 하나부터 열까지

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,659
 모든 게 특별하지 

37
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,980
 너의 관심사, 걸음걸이, 말투와

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,620
 사소한 작은 습관들까지 

39
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,560
 다 말하지

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,600
 너무 작던 내가 영웅이 된 거라고

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,560
 난 말하지, 

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 운명 따윈 처음부터 내 게 아니었다고 

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,379
 Oh no

44
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,379
 세계의 평화

45
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,379
 No way

46
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,379
 거대한 질서

47
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:04,379
 No way

48
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,379
 그저 널 지킬 거야

49
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:06,879
 닌

50
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,879
 (boy with love)

51
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,379
 Listen my, my baby

52
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,560
 나는 저 하늘을 높이 날고 있어

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,879
 (그때 니가 내게 줬던 두 날개로)

54
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,879
 이제 여기 너무 높아

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,560
 난 내 눈에 널 맞추고 싶어

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 Yeah, you makin' me a boy with love (whoo)

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,060
 Oh my my my

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,400
 Oh my my my

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
 You got me high so fast

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
 네 전부를 함께하고 싶어

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,060
 Oh my my my

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,560
 Oh my my my

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
 You got me fly so fast

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
 이제 조금은 나 알겠어

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
 Oh my my my

66
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
 Love is nothing stronger 

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 I want it

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
 Oh my my my

69
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
 than a boy with love

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 than a boy with love

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
 Oh my my my

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 Love is nothing stronger

73
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 Oh my my my

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
 than a boy with love

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
 than a boy with love

77
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,560
툭 까놓고 말할게

78
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,400
 나도 모르게 힘이 들어가기도 했어

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,060
 높아버린 sky 커져버린 hall

80
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,560
 때론 도망치게 해달라며 기도했어

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
 But 너의 상처는 나의 상처

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
 깨달았을 때 나 다짐했던걸 

83
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,460
 니가 준 이카루스의 날개로

84
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,560
 태양이 아닌 너에게로

85
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
 Let me fly

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
 Oh my my my

87
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,659
 I've waited all my life

88
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,560
 네 전부를 함께하고 싶어

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 Oh my my my

90
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
 Looking for something right

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,219
 이제 조금은 나 알겠어

92
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,280
 I want something stronger

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,420
 Than a moment, than a moment, love

94
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,599
 Love is nothing stronger

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,480
 And I want something stronger, love
