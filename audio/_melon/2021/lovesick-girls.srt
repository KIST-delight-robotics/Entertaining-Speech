1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 Lovesick Girls

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,839
 Lovesick Girls

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,099
 영원한 밤

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,280
 창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love 

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,679
 What can we say

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,480
 매번 아파도 외치는 Love

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
 다치고 망가져도 나

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,039
 뭘 믿고 버티는 거야

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,300
 어차피 떠나면 상처투성인 채로

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,580
 미워하게 될 걸

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,380
 끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,520
 이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,939
 아마 다 잠깐일지도 몰라

14
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,700
 우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,420
 But I don't care

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,359
 I'll do it over and over

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,260
 내 세상 속에 너만 있으면 돼

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,500
 We are the lovesick girls

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,219
 네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어

21
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,560
 We are the lovesick girls

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,879
 이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

24
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,680
 But we were born to be alone

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
 Yeah we were born to be alone

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
 Yeah we were born to be alone

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
 But why we still looking for love

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
 No love letters, no X and O's

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,079
 No love, never, my exes know

30
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,960
 No diamond rings that set in stone

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,400
 To the left, better left alone

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,800
 Didn't wanna be a princess

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 I'm priceless

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,719
 A prince not even on my list

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,400
 Love is a drug that I quit

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,840
 No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,160
 아마 다 잠깐일지도 몰라

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
 우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,640
 불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,840
 아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
 We are the lovesick girls

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,540
 네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,260
 We are the lovesick girls

44
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,140
 We are the lovesick girls

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,780
 이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,580
 But we were born to be alone

47
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,300
 Yeah we were born to be alone

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,099
 Yeah we were born to be alone

49
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,939
 But why we still looking for love

50
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,819
 사랑은 slippin' and fallin', 

51
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,740
 사랑은 killing your darling

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,099
 아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림

58
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,280
 들리지 않아 what you say

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,159
 이 아픔이 난 행복해

60
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,859
 나를 불쌍해하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

61
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,620
 We are the lovesick girls

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,299
 네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어

63
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:47,139
 We are the lovesick girls

64
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,579
 이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

65
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,159
 We are the lovesick girls

66
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,280
 모두 결국 떠나가고

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,859
 Lovesick girls

68
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,099
 내 눈물이 무뎌져도

69
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,780
 아프고 또 아파도

70
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,579
 But we're still looking for love
