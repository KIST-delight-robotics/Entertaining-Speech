18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,439
 사정없이 씹으라고 you're lost to me, ya

19
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,299
 사랑 그깟 거 따위 내 눈에 눈물 한 방울 어림없지

20
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,960
 너의 하찮은 말에 미소나 지을 바엔

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,500
 Yeah I'm f***ing tomboy

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,099
 Yeah I'll be the tomboy

23
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:56,140
 This is my attitude

24
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,539
 Yeah I'll be the tomboy

25
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,359
 Said you get up?

26
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,560
 Uh, you get the song right

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,820
 You'll get what I mean "Tomboy", uh

28
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,680
 La- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la-

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,719
 You roll

30
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:19,780
 La- la-la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la- la-

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,960
 Three, two, one

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,420
 I'm a man or a man

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,020
 Just me

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,520
 I am

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,140
 It's neither man nor a man

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,760
 It's neither man nor a man

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,520
 Just me, loving tomboy
