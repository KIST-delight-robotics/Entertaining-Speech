3
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,399
 내게 열리는 건 Big Big Stage

4
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,579
 So that is who I am

5
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,500
 Look at me, look at me, look at me now

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,460
 어제랑 또 다른 짜릿한 나

7
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,359
 두려운 모든 게 설레게

8
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,739
 I'm in sky high, oh my god high

9
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:18,659
 사소한 건 다 아득해져

10
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,379
 Look at me now, look at me now

11
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,659
 I'm On My Way

12
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,840
 넌 그냥 믿으면 돼

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,239
 I'm On My Way

16
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,819
 보이는 그대로야

17
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,500
 너는 누군가의 Dreams Come True

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
 제일 좋은 어느 날의 déjà vu

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,460
 머물고픈 어딘가의 낯선 View

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,879
 I'll be far away

21
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,480
 That's my 

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,980
 life is 아름다운 Galaxy

23
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
 Be a writer

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
 장르로는 Fantasy

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,340
 내일 내게 열리는 건 Big Big Stage

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,480
 So that is who I am

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,719
 어느 깊은 밤

28
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,900
 길을 잃어도

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,420
 차라리 날아올라

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,360
 그럼 내가 지나가는 대로 길이거든

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,980
 1, 2, 3, Fly up

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,960
 I hope you'd be s0omeone's dreams come true

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,960
 제일 좋은 어느 날의 déjà vu

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,960
 머물고픈 어딘가의 낯선 View

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
 I'll be far away

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 That's my life

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,460
 life is 아름다운 Galaxy

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,960
 Be a writer

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,460
 장르로는 Fantasy

42
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,460
 내일 내게 열리는 건 Big Big Stage

43
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
 So that is who I am
