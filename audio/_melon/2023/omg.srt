1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,719
 이 노래는 It's about you baby

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,480
 Only you

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,080
 You you you you you you you

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,480
 내가 힘들 때 울 것 같을 때

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,300
 기운도 이제 나지 않을 때

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,839
 It's you

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,900
 날 걱정하네

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,679
 It's you

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,760
 날 웃게 하네

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,199
 말 안 해도 돼

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,640
 Boy what do you say

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,760
 Boy what do you say

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,619
 멀리선 언제든지 달려와

14
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,539
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

15
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,259
 바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,299
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

17
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,100
 이게 말이 되니

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,240
 날 물어봐

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,200
( They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,399
 너는 말야

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,280
 he's the one that's living in my system, baby

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,600
 Oh my oh my god

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 예상했어 나

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,460
 I was really hoping

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,719
 That he will come through

27
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,159
 Oh my oh my god

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,540
 단 너뿐이야

29
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,939
 Asking all the time

30
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,460
 About what I should do

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,620
 Now I'm asking

32
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,600
 No, I can never let him go

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,720
 너만 생각나 24

34
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,620
 난 행운아야

35
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,460
 정말로 I know I know

36
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,900
 널 알기 전까지는 나

37
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,200
 의미 없었어

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,719
 전부 다 내 맘이

39
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,920
 끝이 없는 걸

40
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
 I know I know

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,540
 I'm going crazy right

42
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,360
 어디서든

43
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,280
 몇 번이든

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,240
 There ain't nothing else that I would hold on to

46
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,159
 I hear his voice

47
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,040
 through all the noise

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,420
 잠시라도 내 손 놓지 마

49
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,320
 걱정 없잖아

50
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,880
 Cause I got someone

51
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,880
 혼자라도 괜찮아

52
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,480
 Cause I love someone

53
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

54
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
 멀리든 언제든지 달려와

55
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

56
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
 바쁜 척도 없이 넌 나타나

57
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

58
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 "이게 말이 되니?" 난 물어봐

59
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,980
 (They keep on asking me, "who is he?")

60
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,980
 너는 말야

61
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,980
 He's the one that's livin' in my system, baby

62
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,980
 Oh my oh my god

63
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,480
 예상했어 나

64
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,980
 I was really hoping

65
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,980
 That he will come through

66
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,480
 Oh my oh my god

67
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,980
 단 너 뿐이야

68
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,480
 Asking all the time

69
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
 About what I should do

70
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 No I can never let him go

71
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
 나만 생각나 24

72
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
 난 행운아야 정말로

73
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 I know I know

74
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
 널 알기 전까지는 나

75
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 의미 없었어 전부 다

76
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 내 맘이 끝이 없는 걸

77
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 I know I know

78
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 He's the one that's living in my system

79
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,480
 Baby baby baby baby baby

80
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 I'm goin' crazy right

81
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,480
 Baby baby I'm goin' crazy right

82
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,479
 Baby baby baby baby

83
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,479
 너와 나

84
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,479
 My heart is glowin' it's glowin' up

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,479
 너랑만 있으면 무서울 게 없어

86
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,479
 가득 메워진, 다 메워진

87
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,479
 My heart is glowing, it'd be glowing

88
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,479
 Cause he

89
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,479
 Oh my oh my god

90
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,979
 예상했어 나

91
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,479
 I was really hoping

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,479
 That he will come through

93
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,979
 Oh my oh my god

94
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,479
 단 너 뿐이야

95
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
 Asking all the time

96

 No I can never let him go

98
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,479
 He's right there for me 24

99
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,479
 난 행운아야 정말로

100
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,479

 My heart is glowin' up so

105
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,479
 I can't sleep at night

106
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 I can't sleep at night

107
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 I can't sleep at night
